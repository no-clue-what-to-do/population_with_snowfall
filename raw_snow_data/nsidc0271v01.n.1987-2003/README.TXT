SUMMARY 

This data set comprises global, monthly satellite-derived snow water
equivalent (SWE) climatologies from November 1978 through June 2003. Global
data are gridded to the Northern and Southern 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth
Grids (EASE-Grids). Global snow water equivalent is derived from Scanning
Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and selected Special Sensor
Microwave/Imagers (SSM/I). Northern Hemisphere data are enhanced with snow
cover frequencies derived from the NOAA Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Weekly
Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent Version 2 data (the snow charts were not
produced for the Southern Hemisphere). These data are suitable for
continental-scale time-series studies of snow cover and water equivalent.

The user's guide contains algorithm and data set derivation details, and
description of EASE-Grid projections.  It is available on-line at

DATA ORGANIZATION

The current version of this data set as of May 1, 2005 is v01.

The data are distributed in a combination of four tarballs, by hemisphere
(Northern or Southern) and sensor time period (SMMR: 1978-1987 and SSM/I:
1987-2003).

Please refer to the user's guide for a description of the directory structure.
